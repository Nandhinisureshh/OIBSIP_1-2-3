**TASK 1- IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION**

This is a machine learning project that classifies the species of iris flowers based on their features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains information about iris flowers from three different species - Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolor, and Iris Virginica. The dataset has 150 observations with 5 features, including the target variable (species).

**INTERPRETATION**

We have evaluated the performance of the model using various metrics such as accuracy score. The final model has an accuracy score of 0.96, which indicates that the model can classify the species of iris flowers accurately.

**TASK 2- UNEMPLOYMENT ANALYSIS USING PYTHON**

Unemployment Analysis Python Project This is a Python project that analyzes unemployment data to identify trends and patterns. The project consists of several Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks that use the Pandas library to clean and analyze data.

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains information about unemployment rates for various States and regions in the India. 

**TASK 3- CAR PRICE PREDICTION**

This is a machine learning project that predicts the price of used cars based on their features such as horsepower, enginesize, citympg and other relevant factors.

The dataset used in this project is sourced from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amankharwal/Website-data/master/CarPrice.csv and contains information about cars from various car brands. The dataset has over 200 observations with 26 features, including the target variable (price).

**INTERPRETATION**

We have evaluated the performance of the model and predicted the price of the car .Linear Regression model Which Shown 71% Accuracy rate and DecisionTreeRegressor is model Which Shown 80% Accuracy rate respectively.This indicates that Decision TreeRegressor model has a good fit and can predict the price of cars accurately.
